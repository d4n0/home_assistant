# Home Assistant
This is a collection of projects that make up my Home Assistant build.



# Alarm System Replacement
This project takes existing [Honeywell 5816 Binary Sensors](https://brinkshome.com/help-center/articles/105-Honeywell-5816-Door-Window-Sensor-Guide) from previous security system and uses RTL-SDR to pass detection packets with MQTT to Home Assistant.
